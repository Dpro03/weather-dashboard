## Weather Dashboard

Users can search for a US city and receive current conditions and a five day forecast for that city on one page. Recents searches are saved underneath the search bar for easy subsequent access to commonly used places. The storage saves five prior searches, then, when a new search is made, the oldest search drops off.

## Project Status

Submitted for evaluation.
